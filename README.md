# Project euler
My solutions to the project euler problems

## What's the project euler?
Basically it is a series of mathematical problems requiring some programming
skills to be solved. Check [their website](https://projecteuler.net/) to know
more about that!

## Why this repo?
After my diploma I felt that I didn't use my mathematical knowledges enough and
I wanted to challenge myself.

Also I though that was a good way to practice Python (or at least its basic
concepts)

So here is this repo. Not all the solutions are the most efficient or the most
elegant but at least they should be working.
